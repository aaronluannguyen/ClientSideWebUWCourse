            Background <br>
            Bruce Wayne, as a child, was struck with the tragedy of having his parents murdered by street criminals
            in an alley in the city of Gotham. Ever since that day, he made a vow to fight injustice to honor his
            parents. He used his family fortunes from their family company, Wayne Enterprises, to travel around the
            world to master as many martial art forms as he could, learning the art of being a detective, and many
            other skills that would eventually lead him towards the hero he is today. He's widely-known as Batman,
            but has also donned many other names such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, and The World's Greatest
            Detective.
            <!-- Make his abilities and skill sets an unorder list here -->
            His abilities are listed as being an master martial artist, combat strategist, having
            inexhaustible wealth, having a brilliant deductive skill, having a genius-level intelligence, being a
            master detective, being a master escapologist, having peak human physical condition, and having access to
            high tech equipment.
