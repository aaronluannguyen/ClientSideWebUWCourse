        <h3> Batman Origins </h3>
        <p>
            Bruce Wayne, as a child, was struck with the tragedy of having his parents murdered by street criminals
            in an alley in the city of Gotham. Ever since that day, he made a vow to fight injustice to honor his
            parents. He used his family fortunes from their family company, Wayne Enterprises, to travel around the
            world to master as many martial art forms as he could, learning the art of being a detective, and many
            other skills that would eventually lead him towards the hero he is today. He's widely-known as Batman,
            but has also donned many other names such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, and The World's Greatest
            Detective.

        <h3> About Batman </h3>
        <p>
            Batman is known for his expertise in hand to hand combat as well as being an expert strategist and his
            seemingly unlimited amount of resources that grant him amazing new gadgets and vehicles. He is also
            recognized for being a superhero with no true powers, and strives toward proving that anyone can be a hero,
            even if you don't have powers. He is driven by his vow as a young child when his parents were brutally
            murdered in front of him. He has a strict moral code which drives him to serve justice without killing a
            person. Batman's most famous villain or foe is The Joker and their rivalry is widely recognized across all
            story arcs that he is involved in.
